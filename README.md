# IlluminAI

Welcome to the IlluminAI repository! This project aims to revolutionize how we understand and manipulate light in 3D environments by leveraging the power of AI and the flexibility of Blender, a popular open-source 3D creation software.

# Overview

IlluminAI extracts, processes, and analyzes data about lighting, objects, world settings, and render settings in Blender scenes. The goal of the project is to provide a better understanding of light interactions in 3D scenes and enable innovative AI-driven techniques for lighting design and rendering in Blender.

# Features

Data Extraction: Using Blender's Python API, the project includes scripts for extracting comprehensive data about Blender scenes, including details about lights, objects, world settings, and render settings.

Data Processing & Analysis: The extracted data is processed and stored in an efficient format for subsequent analysis. This processing includes features like calculating distances between objects and lights, and decomposing light color into individual color channels.

AI-driven Insights: The ultimate goal of the project is to provide AI-driven insights about lighting in 3D scenes. This could include predicting optimal lighting settings, generating new lighting designs, or understanding how changes in the scene affect the lighting.

# Usage

This repository contains a series of Python scripts that can be run in an environment with Blender and Python installed. The scripts are designed to be run on .blend files, which are Blender's native file format. Detailed usage instructions can be found in the repository's README file.

# Future Work

IlluminAI is in its early stages, and there is much more to come! Future plans include integrating more advanced machine learning models, supporting more types of data from Blender scenes, and building a user-friendly interface for interacting with the project's features.

We hope that IlluminAI can become a valuable tool for 3D artists, lighting designers, researchers, and anyone else interested in understanding and manipulating light in 3D environments.

Contributions are welcome, and we look forward to seeing where the community can take this project!
