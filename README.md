Welcome to IlluminAI: Lighting Up the Future of 3D Environments!

This repository houses an innovative project designed to transform our understanding and manipulation of light in 3D environments, marrying the power of artificial intelligence with the flexibility of Blender, a renowned open-source 3D creation suite.

## **Overview**

IlluminAI is a groundbreaking initiative that extracts, processes, and analyzes data from Blender scenes, focusing on lighting, objects, world settings, and render settings. Our ultimate goal is to reveal and enhance our understanding of light interactions in 3D spaces, opening the door to innovative AI-driven techniques for lighting design and rendering in Blender.

## **Key Features**

üí° **Data Extraction**: Leveraging Blender's Python API, we've crafted scripts that extract exhaustive data about Blender scenes, encompassing intricate details about lights, objects, world settings, and render settings.

üîç **Data Processing & Analysis**: The extracted data is meticulously processed and stored in a format optimized for subsequent analysis. This includes innovative features like calculating distances between objects and lights, and decomposing light color into individual color channels.

ü§ñ **AI-driven Insights**: The crux of IlluminAI lies in providing insightful, AI-driven suggestions about lighting in 3D scenes. This could range from predicting optimal lighting settings and generating fresh lighting designs to understanding how scene alterations impact the lighting.

## **Usage**

This repository hosts Python scripts designed to be run in an environment with Blender and Python installed. These scripts are tailored to operate on .blend files, which are Blender's native file format. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the repository's README file.

## **Future Work**

IlluminAI is still in its early stages, and we're brimming with plans for the future! We aim to integrate advanced machine learning models, support a wider variety of data from Blender scenes, and develop a user-friendly interface for an enhanced interaction with the project's features.

IlluminAI seeks to be a valuable asset for 3D artists, lighting designers, researchers, and anyone passionate about understanding and manipulating light in 3D environments. We warmly welcome contributions and are excited to witness the heights the community can take this project to.


Welcome to IlluminAI, where the future of 3D lighting is being written, powered by the brilliance of AI!
